# Salesforce Data Centers

- At any given time, your Salesforce instance is actively served from one location with transactions replicated in near real-time to a **completely redundant, secondary location**. 
- We regularly site switch between the locations for maintenance, compliance, and disaster recovery purposes. 
- As we continue to expand and improve our global infrastructure presence, we recommend customers build their applications **free of specific data center requirements** to support a seamless Salesforce experience.
